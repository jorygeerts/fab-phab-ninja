Filesystem scanning photo album, based on Ninja Framework

Mostly an experiment, the main goal is to have some fun.

## Roadmap
 - Persist data (MongoDB most likely)
 - Authentication (a bit like Flickr their "Guest Pass", but better)
 - Structure by tags and "tag groups"
 - Make directory "just another path". (Maybe?)
 - Editable tags (only in DB, or write into file?)
